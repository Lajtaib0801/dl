# DL
## Why?
I've encountered a lot problems with downloading larger files via wifi, especially on train or wherever the network connection is low, or from slower servers with a few-hundred kB/s download speed.
## Usage
* This program is cli-based, maybe I'll create a gui later for it. For now I'm totally fine with the command line interface.
* You'll need a text file with the following syntax: `<URL> -as <fileName>`. Each line one link and file name pair. Blank lines are allowed.

Descripton to be continued...
